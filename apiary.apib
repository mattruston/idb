The game provides an experience of war seen from an entirely new angle. \n\nThe pace of This War of Mine is imposed by the day and night cycle. During the day snipers outside stop you from leaving your refuge, so you need to focus on maintaining your hideout: crafting, trading and taking care of your survivors. At night, take one of your civilians on a mission to scavenge through a set of unique locations for items that will help you stay alive. \n\nMake life-and-death decisions driven by your conscience. Try to protect everybody from your shelter or sacrifice some of them for longer-term survival. During war, there are no good or bad decisions; there is only survival.

Interactive Entertainment, which takes place in the world of J.R.R. Tolkien's Legendarium. \n \nThe game takes place in the 60-year gap between the events of Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of The Rings. It is a story of revenge, slaughter, and mystery set entirely in Mordor, the Land of Shadows. At its center is Talion, an ordinary man who loses everything, including his mortal life. \n \nThe game is set in a fully open world, and features various role-playing game elements such as experience points and skills. There are various ways the player can complete their main objective. Aside from the main storyline, there are various side quests and random events the player can complete within Mordor. \n \nThe melee system is inspired by that of the Batman Arkham series. Getting into a good fighting rhythm, using both regular attacks and counter-attacks will improve the player's combo multiplier. \n \nA unique feature of Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is the Nemesis system. Every enemy in the game has their own name, rank, and memory. These enemies will continue to do their own jobs and tasks even when they're off screen. If the player does not kill an enemy in an encounter, this enemy will remember the player and change their tactics and conversations based on the encounter.",

You'll never navigate off the planet on your own. Plus, all the heavy weapons have been taken by the assault team leaving you with only a pistol. If you only could get your hands around a plasma rifle or even a shotgun you could take a few down on your way out. Whatever killed your buddies deserves a couple of pellets in the forehead. Securing your helmet, you exit the landing pod. Hopefully you can find more substantial firepower somewhere within the station. As you walk through the main entrance of the base, you hear animal-like growls echoing through the distant corridors. They know you're here. There's no turning back now.",

The player can choose to play through seven different campaigns telling the story, or play in a scenario against computer or human opponents.\nThe gameplay is very similar to its predecessors in that the player controls a number of heroes that command an army of creatures inspired by myth and legend. The gameplay is divided into two parts, tactical overland exploration and a turn based combat system. The player creates an army by spending resources at one of the eight town types in the game. The hero will progress in experience by engaging in combat with enemy heroes and monsters. The conditions for victory vary depending on the map, including conquest of all enemies and towns, collection of a certain amount of a resource, or finding the grail artifact.",

Through a series of unfortunate events, this space train gets shot out of orbit and crash lands on a mysterious planet.. with one survivor. \n \nThe big feature of our game is the randomized elements. The position you spawn on the map, which map you spawn on, the location of chests, enemy spawns, item spawns and more are all randomly chosen by the AI Director! We also have a massive amount of content in our game: we have 100 unique items planned, all with interesting effects. No +HP or +DAMAGE, but chance to spawn missiles and stop time. You have the option of choosing between 10 characters, all with their own different moveset. \n \nAnother thing that\u2019s important in our game is that as time increases, so does difficulty. Represented in a bar on the HUD, every minute increases the enemies\u2019 power and spawn count, developing a great sense of urgency.",

With a can-do attitude, plenty of grit, and her trusty vacpack, Beatrix attempts to stake a claim, amass a fortune, and avoid the continual peril that looms from the rolling, jiggling avalanche of slimes around every corner. \n\n\nSlime Rancher is a first-person, sandbox experience where players will solve problems and survive through mastery of their vacpack: a vacuum/cannon/backpack that can vacuum up and blast out anything that isn\u2019t nailed to the ground. \n\nEach day will present new challenges to players as they attempt to amass a great fortune in the business of slime ranching. While players are free to approach these challenges however they wish, a typical day might look like this: \n\n*You wake at the crack of dawn and get to watering the crops at the ranch. Some slimes are vegetarian, after all. Then it\u2019s time to gather up the plumpest hens from the chicken coop. Some slimes are totally not vegetarian, after all. \n\n*Next, you\u2019re off to feed slimes their breakfast over at the slime corrals so they don\u2019t get too out of hand during the day. Hungry slimes get jumpy. Jumpy slimes can\u2019t be contained. \n\n*With your ranch set for the day, it\u2019s time to begin exploring the untamed wilds of the Far, Far Range. Along the way, you\u2019ll encounter slimes you\u2019ve never seen before, discover a new type of veggie to cultivate back at the ranch, and narrowly avoid certain doom in a valley of burly, feral slimes. \n\n*With the sun setting, it\u2019s time to head back to the ranch, rustle up some dinner for your slimes, and try and figure out just how the heck you\u2019ll keep these new slimes that seem to, well, explode all the time. \n\n*But you can do this. You had the courage to travel a thousand light years away from home to make a living as a slime rancher. Slimes that go boom? No problem. Slimes that burn with a radioactive aura? Bring it on. Slimes that wiggle their butts? Wait, do slimes even have butts?",

His weapon of choice is his shotgun. He is assisted by another man called Chumbucket. Chum mainly works with Max to build and upgrade the Magnum Opus vehicle. \n \nMad Max will feature a variety of weapons which Max can use to defeat enemies. Though the shotgun is Max's weapon of choice, ammo is scarce, and so melee options are the smarter way to go. The 'thunderstick' is an explosive weapon that can be lanced into an enemy's chest, crackling like a lit dynamite fuse before blowing the victim to smithereens. The Harpoon is also one of Max's favorite weapon though it can only be used in-vehicle with Chum riding along. Max's Magnum Opus can be combined with a speedy V12 engine and powerful ramming ability to destroy enemies's vehicles and weaponry. When simultaneously driving and aiming, the game enters slow-motion and allows you to toggle between targets. Not much is known about the vehicular combat and its features. \n \nMad Max will feature crafting system which can be used to craft new weapons and tools. Max's garage can also be used to change and modify the car's engines, chassis, wheels, body works including paint treatment and the \u201cshell\u201d of the auto-mobile and the car\u2019s weight and attributes update accordingly. Max can also be upgraded though it's plans hasn't fully been implemented. \n \nMany choices are given in the game, such as, either playing silently or aggressively. Max can also get guidance from Chum about how he can complete his objectives strategically. However, its largely up to the player how he can complete the objectives.",

Let it be a bright beacon to drive off your enemies or to shed light on dark places. \nGorgeous hand-painted watercolor visuals give Candle that special flair, as all backgrounds and characters have been carefully drawn and then scanned, picture after picture. The game consistently feels like a living painting.",

You incarnate Carl Faubert, a war veteran now private detective who must travel to Atamipek Lake in Northern Canada to solve a simple, yet lucrative case. Your client is a rich industrialist and copper mine magnate who goes by the name of W. Hamilton. The latter accuses the local Cree community of vandalizing and stealing from his summer residence and hunting manor.   \n  \nThe Crees are no friends to Hamilton, as they accuse him of destroying sacred lands for the sole purpose of increased profits. From driving to shooting to scene-searching, Kona combines the atmosphere and immersion of a modern survival title with the deep storytelling and puzzle-solving aspects of a traditional adventure game. By blending and wrapping several gameplay mechanics around its scenario, the game aims to blur the lines that define today's genres.",

Game is currently in early development with set goals.           \n                    \n           \n* PROCEDURALLY GENERATED WORLD - You will play a robot as the main protagonist of Floatlands, going up against other robots. Game world will consist of several biomes: jungle, desert, sea and snow. These worlds will be unique all the time because they will be randomly generated. Islands and natural elements will have certain similarities, but altogether the world will be unique every time.           \n           \nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/scorched-sunset-lowpoly-floatlands.png           \n               \n           \n* QUESTING, POINTS OF INTEREST - There will be random events/quests (defending, collecting, exploring) across the world for you to complete. Quests, missions will also be randomly generated in order to bring the unpredictability aspect to the game.           \n           \nhttps://i0.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/quest-character-lowpoly-floatlands-2.png           \n           \n                    \n* PLAYING STYLES - You can choose different play styles when playing in the world of Floatlands. You can be an explorer or you can be an aggressive player that wants to eliminate threats of well being.           \n                    \n                    \n* RESOURCE GATHERING - Important part will be the resource gathering aspect. Some basics: Shooting down robot enemies will provide you scrap metal; by chopping trees you will gain wood; sheep is a source for wool; you will also find resources in caves. Certain materials need to be processed and smelted in order to be used for building structures. \n \n* CUSTOM BUILD MODE - With gathered resources you\u2019ll be able to build and upgrade your own custom base/shelter and defend from enemies. At this moment there are 50 different build parts you can use to build your base. There are also 3 tiers \u2013 wood (starting tier), stone and fortified stone (highest tier for now). Build mode mixed with random generated terrain provides a multitude of options (basic shacks, castles\u2026), so it will be interesting in this regard. \n \n* ELECTRIC SYSTEM - One other major feature in game is electricity which will provide you with different options in the game - repairing your robot, powering up the lights and your defense system (turrets). We are in the process of making various props that will need a source of energy. Generators will be that source and with cables you'll have the option to connect devices yourself.  You will have to fill generators with fuel to get them to work. \n \nhttps://i1.wp.com/floatlands.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/electricity_connection_lowpoly_floatlands.png",

The first level is in a small arena where you must fight to survive against a relentless torrent of enemies. This level is very simplistic and will probably not be improved in its current form. \n \nThe second level is set in a slime infested warehouse with many shelves and boxes. The objective is to wipe out the slimes before they destroy too much of the warehouse. These slimes will hunt down the player, collect slime balls to grow stronger or attack the shelves and boxes if they can not find the player. Slimes will spawn new slimes when they are strong enough. There are also spiked balls throughout the warehouse that, once active, will charge at the player - damaging anything in their path. Once all the slimes are defeated the level is over. \n \nSome Features and mechanics so far \n- Double jump \n- Enemies AI that prioritise different actions \n - attacking the player \n - collecting power ups \n - attacking the environment \n- Enemy power ups \n - the power of a single enemy can change through out the level",

While players can only explore with four heroes, they will be able to recruit and manage around a dozen heroes from the local tavern or caravan. The heroes are recruited from 15 different classes each class with its own unique skills and abilities. \n \nCombat occurs in narrow passages which means the party's order is important in respect to the heroes' class and the player's strategy. As an example, a crusader is a good front unit having both high attack and defense values while the plague doctor might be better further behind throwing plague bombs to spread disease and confusion. \n \nInstead of leveling, heroes have \"resolve\" which will increase as they adventure. Fighting and events will test the hero's resolve and they might develop afflictions if they fail their resolve. This can turn out both positively and negatively creating different set of afflictions for every hero. \n \nWhile exploring the dungeons, the light of the heroes torch becomes dimmer, which means the dungeons gets more dangerous but yields better loot as well. The heroes have to camp to replenish the torch in the dungeons. Red Hook refers to this as tactical camping because players have to distribute rations among their heroes, protect the camp from ambushes, and reduce the stress levels of the heroes, all costing actions points",

At the same time, a boy called Jack is raised by his outlawed mother in the woods. His apprenticeship as a stonemason paves his way to become a great architect. Soon, his steps lead him to Kingsbridge where he will build one of the greatest cathedrals England has ever seen. Aliena and Richard have to survive on their own, after the sibling's father, the Earl of Shiring, has been incarcerated and murdered. Aliena vows to make her brother the rightful heir and Earl of Shiring. Like Jack, their way leads them to Kingsbridge. Aliena puts her expertise as a tradeswoman to good use, supporting the cathedral's construction and falls in love with Jack. But Kingsbridge and its people are in grave danger. Philip's rivals, Bishop Waleran and Wiliam, a vengeful noble rejected by Aliena, see the town and its rise to importance as a thorn in their flesh. They want to see Kingsbridge burn. \n \nThe game-adaption of the world-bestseller \"The Pillars of the Earth\" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei L\u00fcbbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format. \n \nThe game itself will be released in 2017, at the same time the third novel of the Kingsbridge-Series will be published. The game will be internationally available for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and mobile devices.",

Before the Great War was the Resource Wars, during which the United Nations disbanded, a plague rendered the United States paranoid, and Canada was annexed. The city of Las Vegas itself wasn't hit as hard as most of the other districts, with most buildings being left intact as a result. The Hoover Dam supplies free electricity and water to those who control it.",

While players can only explore with four heroes, they will be able to recruit and manage around a dozen heroes from the local tavern or caravan. The heroes are recruited from 15 different classes each class with its own unique skills and abilities. \n \nCombat occurs in narrow passages which means the party's order is important in respect to the heroes' class and the player's strategy. As an example, a crusader is a good front unit having both high attack and defense values while the plague doctor might be better further behind throwing plague bombs to spread disease and confusion. \n \nInstead of leveling, heroes have \"resolve\" which will increase as they adventure. Fighting and events will test the hero's resolve and they might develop afflictions if they fail their resolve. This can turn out both positively and negatively creating different set of afflictions for every hero. \n \nWhile exploring the dungeons, the light of the heroes torch becomes dimmer, which means the dungeons gets more dangerous but yields better loot as well. The heroes have to camp to replenish the torch in the dungeons. Red Hook refers to this as tactical camping because players have to distribute rations among their heroes, protect the camp from ambushes, and reduce the stress levels of the heroes, all costing actions points",

At the same time, a boy called Jack is raised by his outlawed mother in the woods. His apprenticeship as a stonemason paves his way to become a great architect. Soon, his steps lead him to Kingsbridge where he will build one of the greatest cathedrals England has ever seen. Aliena and Richard have to survive on their own, after the sibling's father, the Earl of Shiring, has been incarcerated and murdered. Aliena vows to make her brother the rightful heir and Earl of Shiring. Like Jack, their way leads them to Kingsbridge. Aliena puts her expertise as a tradeswoman to good use, supporting the cathedral's construction and falls in love with Jack. But Kingsbridge and its people are in grave danger. Philip's rivals, Bishop Waleran and Wiliam, a vengeful noble rejected by Aliena, see the town and its rise to importance as a thorn in their flesh. They want to see Kingsbridge burn. \n \nThe game-adaption of the world-bestseller \"The Pillars of the Earth\" is the first co-operative project of Daedalic Entertainment and Bastei L\u00fcbbe. This game will be more than just complementary media to the book and will instead retell the story in a new, interactive way. A team of about 20 people works to create a multi-platform adaption of this bestseller. The writers are also in contact and co-operation with the Follett Office and Ken Follett himself. Daedalic is the only studio at the time adapting such an epic reading-experience into an interactive format. \n \nThe game itself will be released in 2017, at the same time the third novel of the Kingsbridge-Series will be published. The game will be internationally available for PC, Mac, Linux, PS4, Xbox One and mobile devices.",

                  "description": "In October 1993, Panasonic released the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system. It is a console designed to play multimedia games with photorealistic graphics, full-motion video, and possessed 16-bit, 44-kHz CD-quality sound. The 3DO platform was the first next generation 32-bit game system introduced to the American markets.\n\nNew Technologies Group designers, Dave Needle and RJ Mical invented the blueprint for the 3DO multimedia system. It is a CD-ROM based gaming platform with an emphasis on cel-animation graphics. The quality of the system was obvious to everyone. By the end of 1993, Time magazine had named the Panasonic 3DO system, \"The #1 product of the year.\"\n\nWhen it was released, 3DO Interactive software was a step beyond most current consumer multimedia interactive applications. With its powerful cel engine, the 3DO displays full motion video and fully textured maps and 3D landscapes in 24-bit color.\n\nTrip Hawkins is the founder and CEO of the 3DO Company. Hawkins is also the founder of Electronic Arts, a well-known software publishing company. He has been the driving force behind the creation and development of the 3DO. He had anticipated the day that there would be a standard software for home games. Unfortunately his dream never became reality.\n\nAt its base in Redwood City, CA, the 3DO Company didn't manufacture its own systems. It licensed the technology to other companies, such as Panasonic, Sanyo, Goldstar, and Creative Labs. The consoles contain: double-speed CD-ROM drives, an ARM60 32-bit RISC processor, a digital signal processor which executes intricate graphics manipulation and video decompression. The 3DO system design allows room for expansion with an optional MPEG decoder.\n\nUnfortunately along with 3DO's high commitment to quality games, came an expensive price tag. From the beginning, the system was cost-prohibitive for the average gaming consumer. The original Panasonic player was introduced at a retail price of $700. A year later, the price dropped to $500. By 1995 systems could be purchased for under $300. With the advent of the wildly popular Sony Playstation and later Nintendo 64, the end was in sight for the 3DO system.\n\nMore than two hundred third-party manufacturers were involved in designing software for 3DO. Some of the more well known companies include: Acclaim, Dynamix, Electronic Arts, Origin, Virgin Games, Konami, Crystal Dynamics, and Interplay.\n\nWhat does 3DO stand for? There hasn't been a definite explanation. Some have theorized it means \"3 Dimensional Objects,\" or perhaps it is the next step in the progression of audio and video (\"threede-o\").\n\nThe system can run 3DO interactive software, play audio CDs (including support for CD+G), view photo-CDs, play Video CDs with a special add-on MPEG1 full motion video cartridge. Eight controllers can be used at once on the system.\n\nThe 3DO corporation initially received a royalty for each console sold. They also made three dollars on each 3DO disc sold. Their software royalty was at three dollars per disc. Since they did not directly manufacture the 3DO consoles they had little control over retail pricing. Having sold off manufacturing rights to Matsushita and Sega, in 1996 the 3DO company exclusively entered the software publishing business. They have released such titles as Might and Magic VI and Meridian 59, which is the first significant multiplayer Internet game.",
