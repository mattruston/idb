    "description" : "Founded in 1993 by James Schmalz, Digital Extremes Ltd. proudly ranks as one of the world's top development studios in the interactive entertainment industry.\nHeadquartered in London Ontario, Canada’s 10th largest city, Digital Extremes got its foothold early on in the game industry during the shareware craze of the early 90s. Epic Pinball was a ten month project written entirely in assembly language by Schmalz that went on to become one of the most successful shareware games ever made, trailing only behind such industry greats as Duke3D, Doom and Wolfenstein 3D. Sequels such as Silverball and Extreme Pinball were released shortly thereafter and together they helped fund the creation of what would become one of the industry’s blockbuster franchises, Epic Games’ Unreal®.\n\nBeginning in 1994, Digital Extremes partnered with Epic Games (at that time, its shareware publisher) and co-created Unreal and its counterpart Unreal Tournament. Both games set new standards for first-person action games and broke new ground in online multiplayer gaming. Tremendously rich graphics, fine-tuned gameplay, frenetic action and high quality production value are descriptions that have become synonymous with any Unreal branded game. To date, the award-winning Unreal franchise, including Unreal, Unreal Tournament and Unreal Championship has sold more than 12 million units worldwide across the PC, PlayStation®2, Xbox™ and Dreamcast™ platforms.\n\nDigital Extremes completed development on its original IP for the current generation of consoles, Dark Sector®, which shipped to stores in 2008, using its proprietary next-gen technology, the Evolution Engine™. Following its success, the studio expanded to two teams to allow for simultaneous development on separate projects.\n\nDigital Extremes completed work on the Multiplayer component of 2K Games’ blockbuster, Bioshock® 2 as well as the PC version of THQ hit, Homefront™.  The company also recently ventured into the mobile world with the release of Retro Pinball for Apple’s iOS platform, a throwback to the company’s roots.  More recently, Digital Extremes earned critical acclaim for the development of first-person action game, The Darkness® II, based on the comic book series of the same name.  In addition, the company assisted Microsoft with additional multiplayer content to Halo®4.  The studio is currently developing and publishing the Free-to-Play action game, Warframe",

It took its name from the Norse deity Loki.\n\nAlthough successful in its goal of bringing games to the Linux platform, the company eventually closed due to financial troubles, with it declaring Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection in August 2001 and finally being disbanded in January 2002.\n\nExcerpt from their archived website:\n\"Loki Entertainment Software contracts with successful computer entertainment software companies to port their best selling titles to Linux. A freeware Unix-like operating system, Linux has been dubbed the only true competitor to Windows and has established a solid following in the United States and abroad. Gaming software is an untapped segment of the Linux market with significant potential.\n\nUnlike commercial operating systems developed solely for profit, Linux truly represents the \"power of the people.\" Created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds, a Finnish developer, and made available for free over the Internet, Linux is continually being enhanced by thousands of volunteer developers and programmers around the globe. New capabilities are routinely shared and contributed as software developers have molded the versatile operating system to fit their company's specific needs. While most commercial operating systems go through five to seven revisions per year, Linux might see multiple revisions in a day. There is a virtually unlimited and growing pool of talent supporting the product.\n\nLoki Entertainment Software was founded in August, 1998 with the goal of bringing a broad range of games to Linux. Loki generates revenues for game publishers by bringing proven hits to this significant, new market. Just as Hollywood studios are able to supplement profits by re-releasing movies to video, pay-per-view and international markets, the ports developed by Loki enable publishers to generate additional revenues from existing products without incurring additional costs.\n\nFor Linux users, Loki brings best selling games, fully supported and sold through traditional retail channels -- something the Linux community has been lacking until now. We are very proud of our commitment to Linux, and are excited about bringing a rich gaming experience to our platform of choice.\"",

Formed in Liverpool in 1992, its games were marked by an emphasis on graphical effects with arcade gameplay.\n\nRage's first title Striker sold more than one million copies throughout its two-year life cycle and established Rage as a major creative force in the interactive entertainment industry. The company went through rapid expansion in the 1990s and partnered with multiple third party software publishers for distribution of its titles.\n\nRage Games Limited was floated on the stock exchange in 1996 as Rage Software plc. Rage continued to form commercial partnerships with major publishing houses, including Microsoft, Intel, Dell, Compaq, Nintendo, Sony and Sega, and re-registered as a private company as Rage Software Limited in 1999.\n\nIn 2000, Rage began to expand into publishing. However, the costs of publishing and a run of games that did not sell as expected (most notably the David Beckham franchise) eventually led to the company closing in January 2003 due to bankruptcy. At that time, it was one of the oldest game developers in the UK and at its peak had offices in Liverpool, Birmingham, Sheffield, Newcastle, Bristol and Warrington.\n\nSome of the former development staff have formed other game development companies such as Swordfish Studios in Birmingham, Juice Games in Warrington and Venom Games in Newcastle.",

Turn 10 Studios began working on the original Forza Motorsport to fill the void of simulation racing games on the Xbox console. With an emphasis on driving mechanics and the newest features of Xbox LIVE, the original Forza Motorsport was released in May of 2005 to much critical acclaim and community support. \n \nBuilding off its success, Turn 10’s team immediately began working on a sequel intended to be released on Microsoft’s new Xbox 360 console. Forza Motorsport 2 was released in May of 2007, pushing the boundaries of User Generated Content (UGC) with a robust livery editor and online Auction House, giving casual players new options for expressing their creativity on and off the track. With new online tools, the Forza community thrived as painters, tuners, seller, and racers shared their creations via Forzamotorsport.net. \n \nIn late 2007, Turn 10 Studios began an intense development process for the next Forza installment. Our most ambitious project to date, Forza Motorsport 3 boasted enhanced graphics, driving physics, and UGC. Turn 10 released the game in October 2009 to critical and commercial success. \n \nReleased in October of 2011, Forza Motorsport 4 brought even more excitement to the franchise with Kinect integration, including the stunning Autovista experience. With hundreds of cars rendered in stunning detail, and new tracks to hone skills on, Forza Motorsport 4 was another resounding success for Turn 10 Studios. \n \nWith Forza Horizon, the Forza universe expanded to the open road. Action racing put the player in an open world that demands driving skill and rewards driving style. With lots to explore and a cutting-edge soundtrack to compliment the scenery, Horizon was an evolution of the authentic Forza experience. \n \nIn 2013, Turn 10 released Forza Motorsport 5, the first Forza Motorsport game to appear on the newest Xbox console, Xbox One. Featuring astonishing graphics and cutting-edge features like cloud-powered Drivatar opponents, Forza Motorsport 5 is a landmark racing game that defined the next generation of consoles and continues to appeal to Xbox fans across the world. \n \nForza Horizon 2 was released in 2014, featuring the wide-open spaces of Southern Europe to explore in hundreds of realistic, real-world cars. With a full day-night cycle and dramatic weather effects, Forza Horizon 2 was hailed by fans and critics alike for its beautiful visuals and emphasis on pure fun. In March 2015, Turn 10 released Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious, a standalone expansion for Forza Horizon 2, inspired by the Fast & Furious film series and featuring many of the cars from Universal’s blockbuster action film, Furious 7.",

NIS America, Inc. subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established its North American operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles. The first game to be released in North America by NIS America was Phantom Brave.\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on international publication of their works in the U.S., given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the U.S. were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus. The publisher has become a somewhat of a well-known presence in the North American market, having won RPGLand's \"Stateside Publisher of the Year Award\" in 2009.",

The studio focused largely on creating new intellectual property rather than sequels. When these failed to perform on par with Capcom's more popular series, Capcom attempted to merge the studio back into their internal R&amp;D. Those at the studio chose instead to leave the company, and Clover was dissolved.\n\nSome of the key members of Clover founded Seeds Inc., a new development group that merged with ODD Incorporated in October 2007 to form PlatinumGames, which has since built up a staff composed of former Clover staff.

Thanks to the digital publishing revolution we are able to fund our own ideas and create games that we really want to make, without any outside interference. \n \nOur biggest hit so far was Zombie Driver with it's console remake Zombie Driver HD which we self-published on the PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Android and Xbox One. The next upcoming game is titled X-Morph: Defense and will be available for PC, Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in 2017.

It was founded in 2009 by Amir Rao and Gavin Simon, and currently consists of employees in San Jose and other locations. Several of its team members were former developers from the Electronic Arts Los Angeles studio, which developed the Command &amp; Conquer series of video games.\n\nTheir first game, Bastion, received high critical praise, including being listed among several \"Game of the Year\" lists from game journalists. It was first shown in mid-development at the 2010 Penny Arcade Expo as part of its \"PAX 10\" highlight ten upcoming independently developed games. This attracted several publishers who wanted to help distribute the game, but Supergiant Games found that Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment shared the same vision they had for the game. Supergiant selected them as their publishing partner, enabling them not only to distribute the game to Xbox Live Arcade but as a premiere title during the 2011 \"Summer of Arcade\" promotion.\n\nIn March 2013, Supergiant Games announced their next title, Transistor, released on May 20 2014. A promotion video was released March 19. The game features a female protagonist, Red, in a cyberpunk-like city, who had gained possession of a powerful weapon that she is nearly killed for possessing. The game features a similar isometric viewpoint to Bastion. Transistor was similarly met with critical acclaim with an average critic score of 83 on Metacritic.",

We expect 2016 to be an exciting year with the full release of Grim Dawn in February 2016, the start of its expansion and possibly the announcement of another new project.  \n  \nCrate Entertainment was founded in 2008 by former Iron Lore lead designer Arthur Bruno with the goal of continuing to create deep gameplay, with creative integrity, in original fictional settings. At a time when some were still proclaiming the demise of PC gaming, the founding of Crate was, to some degree, a way to keep working on the type of more traditional, complex PC games that we love.  \n  \nIn late 2009, Crate acquired the rights to the Iron Lore codebase and began working on a new Action-RPG that would become Grim Dawn. For the first few years, Grim Dawn plodded along with only two full-time developers, supported by volunteers. The team grew and work accelerated thanks to a successful Kickstarter campaign in May 2012, the alpha release of Grim Dawn in May 2013 and the game's debut on Steam Early Access in November 2013.",

They have developed the much acclaimed GOTHIC® (publisher: Shoebox and JoWooD) and Risen® (publisher: Deep Silver) computer roleplaying series.\n\nPluto 13 GmbH was founded in 2002 by employees and management of Piranha Bytes Software GmbH. Piranha Bytes Software GmbH was itself founded in 1997 and later (1999) turned into a 100% subsidiary of Phenomedia AG, a company listed on Germany’s Neuer Markt stock exchange. In 2001 the first GOTHIC game was released to the public. In May 2002 Phenomedia AG went into insolvency proceedings due to irregularities for which several former group managers (not Piranha Bytes’ management!) have been tried for in a German criminal court of law.\n\nIt was therefore decided to make a clean cut and negotiate an MBO with the administrator, which was concluded in September 2002. Pluto 13 GmbH was founded and major assets, trademarks and most staff were transferred to the new company. One of the four original founders remained with the team in a leading position.\n\nPluto 13 GmbH is a privately owned limited liability corporation under German law, all shares are held by staff and management. Current (2013) permanent staff is around 20 people - all but of one doing active development (designers, programmers, scripters, artists...).",
