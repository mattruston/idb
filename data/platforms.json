    "summary" : "In October 1993, Panasonic released the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer system. It is a console designed to play multimedia games with photorealistic graphics, full-motion video, and possessed 16-bit, 44-kHz CD-quality sound. The 3DO platform was the first next generation 32-bit game system introduced to the American markets.\n\nNew Technologies Group designers, Dave Needle and RJ Mical invented the blueprint for the 3DO multimedia system. It is a CD-ROM based gaming platform with an emphasis on cel-animation graphics. The quality of the system was obvious to everyone. By the end of 1993, Time magazine had named the Panasonic 3DO system, \"The #1 product of the year.\"\n\nWhen it was released, 3DO Interactive software was a step beyond most current consumer multimedia interactive applications. With its powerful cel engine, the 3DO displays full motion video and fully textured maps and 3D landscapes in 24-bit color.\n\nTrip Hawkins is the founder and CEO of the 3DO Company. Hawkins is also the founder of Electronic Arts, a well-known software publishing company. He has been the driving force behind the creation and development of the 3DO. He had anticipated the day that there would be a standard software for home games. Unfortunately his dream never became reality.\n\nAt its base in Redwood City, CA, the 3DO Company didn't manufacture its own systems. It licensed the technology to other companies, such as Panasonic, Sanyo, Goldstar, and Creative Labs. The consoles contain: double-speed CD-ROM drives, an ARM60 32-bit RISC processor, a digital signal processor which executes intricate graphics manipulation and video decompression. The 3DO system design allows room for expansion with an optional MPEG decoder.\n\nUnfortunately along with 3DO's high commitment to quality games, came an expensive price tag. From the beginning, the system was cost-prohibitive for the average gaming consumer. The original Panasonic player was introduced at a retail price of $700. A year later, the price dropped to $500. By 1995 systems could be purchased for under $300. With the advent of the wildly popular Sony Playstation and later Nintendo 64, the end was in sight for the 3DO system.\n\nMore than two hundred third-party manufacturers were involved in designing software for 3DO. Some of the more well known companies include: Acclaim, Dynamix, Electronic Arts, Origin, Virgin Games, Konami, Crystal Dynamics, and Interplay.\n\nWhat does 3DO stand for? There hasn't been a definite explanation. Some have theorized it means \"3 Dimensional Objects,\" or perhaps it is the next step in the progression of audio and video (\"threede-o\").\n\nThe system can run 3DO interactive software, play audio CDs (including support for CD+G), view photo-CDs, play Video CDs with a special add-on MPEG1 full motion video cartridge. Eight controllers can be used at once on the system.\n\nThe 3DO corporation initially received a royalty for each console sold. They also made three dollars on each 3DO disc sold. Their software royalty was at three dollars per disc. Since they did not directly manufacture the 3DO consoles they had little control over retail pricing. Having sold off manufacturing rights to Matsushita and Sega, in 1996 the 3DO company exclusively entered the software publishing business. They have released such titles as Might and Magic VI and Meridian 59, which is the first significant multiplayer Internet game.",

    "summary" : "The rather obscure VC 4000 Video Computer, manufactured by Interton company, is regarded as the only console entirely developed in (West-)Germany. Whether or not that is true will probably remain a secret as the system's (still existing) former distributor has scrapped any documentation of the product that nearly got the company into bankruptcy. Information on the internet about the console's development history, however, is often contradictionary, inaccurate and often blatantly false. \nFor instance, the most common and aggravating misconception is that the VC 4000 is \"based on\" the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System, which supposedly was released as early as 1976! That would mean, that the technology used in the VC 4000 predates Atari's VCS by about a year and competes with Fairchild's Channel F for the title \"first 2nd generation video game system\". However, it is actually enough to compare the graphic capabilites of the two systems to realise that such information must be rubbish. So, here are some clarifying facts: \nBoth, the VC 4000 and the 1292 APVS, are built around the Signetics 2650 microprocessor, which was released in late 1975. That was around the same time when Philips had bought the Signetics company and shipped the technology over to Europe. At that time Philips' subsidary Magnavox was developing a system based on the arguably more powerful Intel 8048 microprocessor - that system would later become known as the G7000 (or Odyssey² in the USA). Having one hardware product already in development, Philips decided to treat the Signetics 2650 as commercial product, targeting small-sized electronic-manufacturers, who were already swarming the market with PONG-clones. \nConsidering that the VC 4000 is software-compatible (but not slot-compatible!) with the 1292 APVS, and considering that the two systems share the early half of their game library with identical game-titles implies the hypothesis that Philips sold both, the Signetics 2650 hardware and a certain number of developed ROM-software to two or three dozen companies, who developed, admittedly different, but ultimately compatible gaming systems, namely the VC 4000 and the 1292 Advanced Programmable Video System. The misconception that the 1292 APVS was released already in 1976 is probably owed to the - by now viral - misinformation that Radofin (the most prominent 1292 APVS manufacturer) released its first cosoles in 1976. These, however, were no microprocessored early wonder-machines, but plain PONG-clones. \nMore evidence to support this hypothesis is provided by a Swedish TV broadcast from April 1979, when a team from SVT (Swedish broadcast company) visited the Philips-reasearch-centre in Eindhoven, Netherlands to talk about the future of video games. Throught the video the developers are seen with VC 4000 controllers, testing game prototypes which graphicly correspond with games on the VC 4000\/1292 APVS and not Philips' own home console, the Videopac G7000, \nAvailable evidence, primarly in the form of leaflets, suggests that German manufacturer Interton was indeed the first one to hit the market with a Signetics 2650 microprocessor-based gaming system in autumn 1978: the VC 4000. Leaflets for 1292 APVS consoles by Radofin, Acetronic and other companies would only appear in 1979.",

    "summary" : "The world was undergoing \"PONG Madness\". It seemed only natural that developers would create advancements to the original AY-3-8500 chip to incorporate color and even more games. This explains the amount of PONG systems since each machine contained a different chip. However things were handled different in some areas particularly in Europe. \n \nEurope did not see the release of the Intellivision and Atari 2600 till the early 1980s. This allowed Pong to have a longer success. Rather then creating a new machine for each new chip, developers took the General Instruments popular line of chips and slapped them into cartridges. These carts were not like ROM carts used in later systems. They simply housed a specific General Instruments processor chip with pin outs to interface with a console. These were the PC-50X line of cartridges. \n \nWith the PC-50X cartridges available, console manufacturers were able to produce a machine that could play several games and market them at a low cost. The units were made in various countries and were marketed by Creatronic, Hanimex, ITMC, Rollet, GrandStand, Soundic and lord knows how many other manufacturers. There are literally over two hundred console variations that utilized this technology. \n \nThe initial model SD-050 varied in terms of outward appearance (colors, etc), manufacturers names and slight modifications. However each unit had the same overall design with two detachable controllers with 10 buttons located on the top of the machine. These 10 buttons, which clearly identify a PC-50X based console, were used to select the different games available on each cart. The SD-050 model only produced black and white video. \n \nNew models such as the SD-070 and SD-090 appeared and sold well into the 80s since the units were far cheaper then the newer consoles making waves in the US and Japan. These newer models played the same carts, but added additional settings, sound and SECAM color (4 colors).",
